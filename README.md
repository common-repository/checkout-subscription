SendinBlue Subscription on WooCommerce Checkout plugin helps the WooCommerce Customers to Opt-in to SendinBlue Newsletter subscription on the checkout page itself. 

== Description ==
Collecting your customer's email to the SendinBlue campaign list is an annoying thing to a customer and often we miss the data. That is why we intended to create a minimalistic method to add customer email to campaign list. When customers about to place the order on the WooCommerce checkout page, WooCommerce collects the customer's name, email and other information for order details. So we made a smart move thereby placing a simple and minimalistic opt-in checkbox so customers also won't feel get annoyed with popups and questions and so on. This plugin also gives an option to mark the newsletter subscription by default, at anytime customers can opt-out before checkout. This process will capture the customer's name, email and send them directly to the defined SendinBlue subscription list.
